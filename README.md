# Motivation
I was once working on a project, doing my thing, and was looking for a folder stuffed _somewhere_ in a directory I often used. So, I opened Windows file explorer and... was stuck waiting for _a solid couple of seconds_ for it to open, then spent _several more_ just searching for that folder.

Now, I know waiting several seconds for an app to open isn't that big of a deal - In fact, I'd say I'm even one of the more patient people out there - but this happens to me a lot, and using it often feels slow and sometimes even frustrating (at least to me).

There were many features, big and small, that I just wished it had.

So I made my own.

It's obviously not perfect but it's certainly way faster to boot up (and to use), and more configurable than Windows file explorer ðŸ˜Ž
